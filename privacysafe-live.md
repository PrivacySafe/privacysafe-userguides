### ‚ÄúAs User how do I‚Ä¶‚Äù

All of these are for **BigBlueButton** (which powers **PrivacySafe Live**):


#### üéß Join the Audio

BigBlueButton supports audio through either your **computer microphone and speakers** or via a **dial-in phone number**.

When you first enter a session, you‚Äôll be prompted to **join the audio**. You have two choices:

1. **Microphone** ‚Äì to speak and listen
2. **Listen only** ‚Äì to listen only

##### üîä Choosing Microphone or Listen Only

Once you click **Join Audio**, the system will prompt you with:

* **Allow microphone access**: Accept this prompt in your browser.
* **Echo Test**: Speak a few words to test your microphone. You‚Äôll hear your voice echoed back.

If successful, you‚Äôll hear ‚ÄúYou are now muted‚Äù (until you unmute yourself).

If not successful, BigBlueButton will offer the option to **retry**.

Webcam sharing lets participants see each other and builds engagement during sessions.

##### üîê Granting Access

Your browser will ask for webcam access. You must click **Allow**.

> Note: Webcam access may not be available on all mobile browsers. For best results, use **Chrome** or **Firefox** on desktop.

</div>

You can share your webcam **even if someone else is already sharing theirs**. Multiple webcams are supported.

> üìå Webcam video appears in the **upper-left or upper-right corner** by default.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://support.bigbluebutton.org/hc/article_attachments/4409928583188" alt="Webcam Moved" width="500" />
