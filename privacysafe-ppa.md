# ðŸ“¦ Installing Software via PrivacySafe OS PPAs

PrivacySafe maintains three official package repositories (PPAs) that deliver secure, privacy-focused software for PrivacySafe OS systems. These PPAs can be used whether you're running PrivacySafe OS from downloaded media or preinstalled on hardware such as the Launchpad Pro tablet.

- **Enterprise Release** (stable builds): 
  [https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-release](https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-release)

- **Enterprise Testing** (pre-release QA builds): 
  [https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-testing](https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-testing)

- **Enterprise Nightly** (automated development builds): 
  [https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-nightly](https://launchpad.net/~privacysafe/+archive/ubuntu/enterprise-nightly)

PrivacySafe OS is available in two supported editions. The instructions below are organized based on how you acquired your system.
