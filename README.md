# üõ°Ô∏è PrivacySafe: Speak, Share &amp; Work Safely

Welcome to [PrivacySafe](https://privacysafe.app)! Our apps deliver privacy and security while you communicate, collaborate, and work. PrivacySafe apps run locally on your machine and interact with zero-knowledge servers. What does that mean? Simply put, the servers don't know who you are, what you're doing, or even which apps you're using.

## üîí PrivacySafe Enterprise Suite

Our Enterprise Suite is a bundle of productivity tools for your organization that either uses our PrivacySafe Service for identity and authentication or, optionally, your organization's internal network and access controls. We deliver secure collaboration tools that replace apps like **Signal**, **Telegram**, **WhatsApp**, and **DropBox**. Even the most powerful officials can [make mistakes](https://psafe.ly/3DHNgz) when attempting to communicate securely &ndash; with our Enterprise Suite, your people have approved communication tools for both routine tasks and high-risk situations. These apps are confidential and portable, running smoothly on all major desktop operating systems (Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux).

### Key Features
- üí¨ **Secure Chat**: Private, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging for your team.
- üìû **Video Calls**: High-quality, secure video meetings without any worry.
- üìÇ **Encrypted Storage**: Keep your files safe with zero-knowledge encryption.
- üë• **Private Contacts**: Store and manage contacts privately, without any third-party access.
- üîÑ **Verified Updates**: Automatic, verified updates to keep your apps secure and up-to-date.
- üß∞ **Sandboxed Tools**: A safe, compartmentalized environment for collaboration.

We all know how important it is to keep your data private. That's why PrivacySafe gives you full control over your information &ndash; without any of the tracking or data collection you might find in other apps. All of our code is free and [open source software](https://github.com/PrivacySafe) (FOSS), which means security researchers and developers can inspect the code and contribute improvements. We also host ourprotocols, formats, and APIs at [IEEE SA Open](https://opensource.ieee.org/3nweb), the world's largest and most respected technical professional organization.

As a partner of PrivacySafe, you're getting a secure, sandboxed environment for your organization. With our help, you can integrate secure collaboration into your domain and controls, deploying a custom security solution that can even feature your branding.

## üóÇÔ∏è Using PrivacySafe Storage

PrivacySafe Storage is your feature-rich, secure file manager designed to store and manage your digital assets. Whether you're working with photos, videos, PDFs, or other documents, PrivacySafe Storage keeps your files safe, encrypted, and easily accessible.

### Navigating the Storage App
Upon opening **PrivacySafe Storage**, you'll see a clean, user-friendly interface for managing your files. You can toggle between different file viewing modes and access your important files with ease.

The left sidebar offers quick access to **Home**, **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **Trash**, helping you quickly navigate to the sections you use the most.

### File Preview
In **PrivacySafe Storage**, files such as **photos**, **videos**, and **PDF documents** can be previewed directly in the file list. For images and video files, **thumbnails** are displayed to give you a visual cue of your file's content.

For example:
- **Image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)** will show a thumbnail of the image itself.
- **Video files (MP4, MOV, etc.)** will show a thumbnail of the first frame of the video.
- **PDF documents** will display the first page of the document as a thumbnail.

This feature makes it easy to visually identify your files, especially when managing large collections.

<p align="center">
